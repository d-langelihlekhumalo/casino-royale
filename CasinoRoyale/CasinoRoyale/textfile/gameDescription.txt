Develop a Windows application using C#, to create a Five Die Game. Please create a GUI
   interface that is both creative and pleasant to the eye. Keep in mind the rules 
 regarding interface design. Your Die application randomly “throws” five dice for the 
  computer and five dice for the player. The application displays the die values for 
   both the computer and player. The winner will be decided based on the following 
 hierarchy of Die values. Any higher combination beats a lower one; for example, five 
          of a kind beat four of a kind; 4 of a kind beat 3 of a kind etc.
						Five of a kind
						Four of a kind
						Three of a kind
						A pair
  For this game, the dice values count; for example, when both players have the same
    combination of dice, the higher value wins. For example, two 6s beats two 5s.
 Display whether the computer or player is the winner for each round. Allow the player
 to continue playing the game for as long as he wants. Keep running scores showing the 
    number of wins for the player as well as for the computer as the game progresses.
   Use menus to provide the player with options to Exit the game, Help explaining the 
 rules of the game for new players and an About option providing information about 
   game developer, i.e., yourself. The features described above are the bare minimum 
          requirements. Any additional functionality will enhance your game.
